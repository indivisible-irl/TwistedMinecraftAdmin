## server.info -- Supplementary server configuration file
##   For use with TwistedMinecraftAdmin program written by indivisible.
##   Should be included in the root of all Minecraft Server instances.
##   (May move to a json or yaml file format in the future. API will be unaffected, as expected.)

## All key, value pairs must be separated by a '=' character. Do not use '=' anywhere else (for now).
